# Overview


I created a Quarto file (.qmd) using R to create and visualize a Linear Regression model in a dataframe.

The purpose of writing this software was to expand my knowledge of Quarto files and to experiment with using R and various libraries to create a polished final project.

# Development Environment

RStudio is the standard way of building with R, and worked great for this project

R is the programming language I used, and I used the tidyverse library, which bundles together great libraries for manipulating and visualizing data, including ggplot and dyplr.
